# Recipe Finder Website
Instead of searching for a dish according to it's name, I am asking for some ingredients and suggesting possible dishes that can be made using these ingredients. 
For this project I am using the Recipe Dataset (over 2M) Food publicly available in kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wilmerarltstrmberg/recipe-dataset-over-2m/data
Since the dataset file size is very big I couldn't include it here, you can clone my repo and download the dataset from above link. 
Make sure to name the file as recipes_data.csv
